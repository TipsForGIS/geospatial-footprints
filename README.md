A footprint for an incedent on a road segment between two segments  There is a sample GeoJSON file for some of the place names in George Mason University, Fairfax campus.

A maintenance site on sager ave between university dr and east st  Technologies used in this code are: Bootstrap, MapBox, and TurfJS
